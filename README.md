# SpartaHackII-iOS
The next generation SpartaHack iOS app. 


Current home of the SpartaHack II iOS app. 

As of right now, this project needs XCode 6 or later to build and the current target is iOS 8.3 

Parse support is really buggy in iOS 9 and I couldn't get the project to compile in it. So, until that's resolved I'm sticking with iOS 8
Apple watch support is planned but will be relased at a later date.
